Homework for the third week on Advanced Programming in C++ AAU Klagenfurt

HOMEWORK 3: Templates, Headers, and Libraries

1. Modify your program that implements the bubble sort using templates and static libraries
  defined by you.
  
2. Write a program to enter and display two data members of a class using class template. Define the member functions outside the class.

3. Create generic class Stack<> by using templates and implement generic methods to push/pop elements from the stack and to find the sum, the maximal element and the number of elements in the Stack (Not for string type!)

4. Create a console-based application that takes positive binary numbers of no more than 16 digits as an input from the user. Read this value in as an int/long int type value (you can use templates). 
The first function of your program will be to make sure that the user indeed entered a binary number (only 1's and 0's). 
If it isn't, then the user is prompted again. 
If it is binary, then your program should calculate the equivalent decimal value (base 10 -- the number system we commonly use). 
You have to use headers for this assignment!
